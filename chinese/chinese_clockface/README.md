# Chinese speaking club @ Ziferblat (Clockface)

## Overview

Chineses - the most widespread language in a modern world.

More than 80 thousands of hieroglyphs plus 4 tones - the «китайская грамота» idiom
didn't came out of nowhere! But it's not necessary to know all of those symbols
in order to speak Chinese. We're going to learn this practical subset that is
enough for us to communicate.

There are 2 meetings:
* One for beginners at every Tuesday, 19:00
* One for advanced at every Thursday, 19:00
