# Hebrew speaking club @ Ziferblat (Clockface)

## Overview

Hebrew - one of the most ancient languages. It's at least 3500 years old.
There is a legend that this world was written in Hebrew...

We're not only speaking Hebrew here, but also doing translations, reading and writing!
A skill to write and speak a visa-free entry country language - isn't that super useful?

There are 2 meetings:
* One for beginners at every Tuesday, 19:00
* One for advanced at every Thursday, 19:00
